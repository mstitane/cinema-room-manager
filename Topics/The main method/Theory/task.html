<p>Java is primarily an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an object is an instance of a class. | It represents a real-world entity with a specific state and behavior. The state of an object is defined by the values assigned to its fields or attributes, while its behavior is defined by the methods it can execute. Objects are created on the heap and are accessed through references, which are variables that store the memory address of the object.">object</a>-oriented language. It means a Java program can be considered as a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3770" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A collection in Java is a data structure that can hold multiple elements, providing a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate those elements efficiently. | It is part of the Java Collection Framework, which includes interfaces and classes for commonly used data structures such as lists, sets, and queues. Collections can be resizable, and they offer methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, often with better performance characteristics than arrays. They can also be mutable or immutable, and they can be generic or non-generic.">collection</a> of objects that communicate via calling each other's methods. A typical Java program includes a lot of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A class in Java is a fundamental concept that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. | It defines the properties and behaviors of an object through the use of fields and methods. Fields describe the object's characteristics, while methods describe what the object can do. Classes can be divided into two categories: instance and static. Instance classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name, and can have any name that does not start with a digit.">classes</a>, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An interface in Java is a reference type that contains method declarations, serving as a literal interface between a class inheriting that interface and other classes. | Unlike a class, an interface can extend multiple interfaces, and a class can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces are crucial in Java for achieving abstraction, focusing on the essential features of real-world objects. They can have public constants, abstract methods, default methods with implementation, static methods with implementation, and private methods with implementation.">interfaces</a>, objects, and other concepts from object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Even the simplest "procedural-style" program should have at least one class and the main method inside to start the program. The main method is the entry point for any application. It means that the execution of any program begins right here. Ever since Java 7, there has been no other way to start an application than with this method (excluding the case in which you start your application inside a special container for applications but this is not considered in our materials).</p>
<p>Let's see an example of the simplest application that <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'print' is a statement used to display output to the console. | It writes the specified text or variable value to the standard output stream, which is typically the console. Unlike 'println', 'print' does not add a newline character after the output, meaning that subsequent print statements will continue writing on the same line. It's a fundamental tool for providing feedback and displaying results in a Java program.">prints</a> the text <strong>"Hello, Java"</strong> to the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The standard output in Java refers to the default location where a Java program prints its output. | This is usually the console or terminal window where the program is run. It is often used to display messages, results, or any other information that the program needs to communicate to the user. The standard output is typically accessed through the System.out object, which represents the standard output stream in Java.">standard output</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is a class named <code class="language-java">Main</code>. The class contains <strong>the main method</strong> for starting the program.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that a class containing the main method can have any name, but the main method should always have the name <code class="language-java">main</code>.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Declaration in Java is the process of defining a variable, method, or class by specifying its name, type, and other attributes. | When declaring a variable, you specify its data type and name, and optionally initialize it with a value. Declaring a variable with a specific type can be lengthy and difficult to read, but starting from Java 10, you can use the var keyword instead of a specific type to force automatic type inference based on the type of assigned value.">declaration</a> of the main method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>the keyword <code class="language-java">public</code> indicates that the method can be invoked from everywhere;</li>
<li>the keyword <code class="language-java">static</code> indicates the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class;</li>
<li>the keyword <code class="language-java">void</code> indicates the method doesn't return any value;</li>
<li>the array variable <code class="language-java">args</code> contains arguments entered at the command line, the array is empty if there are no arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, even the simplest Java application contains a lot of concepts. All of them will be studied in the next topics related to methods and object-oriented programming. Now you should just understand how to write and run a simple Java program with <strong>the main method</strong>.</p>

<h5 id="invalid-declarations-of-the-main-method" style="text-align: center;">Invalid declarations of the main method</h5>
<p>If the main method has an invalid declaration, two cases are possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>your program cannot be compiled</li>
<li>your program is successfully <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, compile is the process of translating source code into bytecode, which is a platform-independent code that can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). | This process is performed by the Java compiler, which checks the source code for syntax errors and generates a .class file containing the bytecode. The JVM then loads and executes this bytecode, enabling the write once, run anywhere philosophy of Java.

</ul>
<p><strong>Your program cannot be compiled. </strong>This is the case when the main method declaration breaks the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Syntax in Java refers to the set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid. | It includes specific keywords that have special meanings in the programming language, which cannot be used as variable names in your own program.

Whitespace includes all characters that are not visible, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.">syntax</a> of Java.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>invalid method declaration: no return value (even <code class="language-java">void</code>).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static main(String[] args)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>invalid method declaration: a mistake in the keyword (<code class="language-java">pulic</code> instead of <code class="language-java">public</code>).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">pulic static void main(String[] args)</code></pre>
<p><strong>A program can be compiled but cannot be run.</strong> This is the case when the main method has a correct declaration as a regular method but doesn't satisfy the specific requirement of the main method.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>invalid arguments (should be <code class="language-java">String[] args</code>)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java");
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>the method declaration has no keyword <code class="language-java">static</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">public void main(String[] args) {

<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>So, the main method is the entry point of any Java program. It has a very specific syntax which you need to remember. The declaration of the method must adhere to certain rules, including the keywords <code class="language-java">public</code>, <code class="language-java">static</code>, and <code class="language-java">void</code>, as well as the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a parameter is a variable that is used within a method to receive a value that is passed to the method when it is invoked. | The parameter definition includes the type, number, and order of the parameters, which reflects how they will be passed to the method. A method may have a parameterized argument and return type, and the class provides methods to examine the return type or argument of the method. The parameter of a method is a value that is used inside the method, and it is declared in the parentheses following the method name.">parameter</a> <code class="language-java">String[] args</code>. Incorrect declaration of the main method can lead to the program being unable to compile.</p>
